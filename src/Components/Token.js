        A highly prized token in the entire ANIMAL WORLD. It is earned through a
        series of processes. Whenever a particular Tree is planted it will reap
        the respective commodity in a few hoursâ€™ time. That commodity is then
        sent for processing and a finished product is manufactured. This
        processed commodity will be then listed for sale in the market. IN
